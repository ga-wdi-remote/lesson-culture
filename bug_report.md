# Bug Reports!

## Why?

Being able to talk about your code, errors, things you've tried and so forth is one of the skills we will constantly work on. Your ability to discuss your code with your peers after hours, with the TA, with us when we call on you regardless of whether you understand the code perfectly or not will help you not just in class, but also prep you for interviews.

To help you build this skill we will call on you in class to make hypothesis about what the code is doing, we'll ask you to explain and defend your own code during project presentations, and we'll ask you to submit a nightly bug report.

Bug reports will be your first line of attack at building this skill.

## What?

Every night you will have homework - literally every night - and will need to submit it in a GitHub issue on the main repo. During this process you will inevitably run into errors.

You will need to document at least one and submit your analysis in a separate issue labeled `[Bug Report]`.  

## The Content

#### WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:
**Provide Context!**
*Write a detailed explanation of the problem you're solving.*

#### DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:

*A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and the error.*

*This means the full steps to reproduce, screenshots or the code pasted, the line number of where the relevant code is.
The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot,* **not paraphrased.**

#### WHAT YOU THOUGHT THE ERROR WAS

Rarely will you diagnose your error on the first attempt. It takes testing and experimentation.

Documenting your debugging process by tracking what you thought the error was initially, what led you to believe that, and your subsequent theories upon proving that true or not will help improve not just your own debugging skills but also hopefully solidify your understanding of how your code was working or not.

#### What you did to solve it

Ideally at the end of your debugging process you will arrive at an answer/solution. Maybe you just typoed something or maybe your understanding of how a certain structure or function worked was slightly inaccurate.

#### What was the error actually  

As detailed above your first and maybe even fifth hypothesis won't be right. So after solving it, what was actually the problem? Did you misread or misinterpret the error? Was the error just the first error in several different ones that allowed you to arrive at your solution?

Explain that!
